## Project Description:
This assignment was meant to help me understand the concepts of GIT, GITHub, local and remote repositories, and how they all function together. Using these concepts, I can edit, push and share my files to other users on the remote repository, without having to worry about losing past states or versions of my files.

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. GIT saves files using snapshots. Meaning, each time the state is saved, GIT does so by storing it in its own mini filing system after taking a virtual snapshot of the entire file.
2. GIT saves these files onto my own GIT repository. The projects I work on will be located and stored in the same location as the repository. 
3. The push command will send my work to the remote repository. The status command will show my current status, changed files, and anything that needs to be or has not yet been added or committed.
